<aside class="notes">

With the November Release "[Data Packs](/features/databacks)" are a key new feature.

Datapacks provide you the ability to optionally import sample data.

The Return on investment data pack allows you to rapidly demonstrate planning, metering and monitoring of return on investment via the Automation Kit Power BI dashboard.

<aside class="notes">

In future milestones we will look to improve the datapacks by including them as an optional part of the Automation Kit automated install process.

The ability to include Data Packs as part of the install will allow for a web based install, rather than the command line install process for this release.
