<aside class="notes">

The key features of the Automation Kit are to allow you to manage, govern and scale automation adoption by leveraging the experiences that we have gained from working with customers worldwide.

We do this by allowing you to monitor in near real time, the planning and impact of projected savings against actual savings based on monitored automation analytics.

The kit focuses on a range of personas from business decision makers, process owners, makers to create the automation process and administration teams so that each user group can measure the impact of the investment.

This process is supported by hyper automation leveraging the value of the Microsoft Cloud to provide and end to end Application Lifecycle management process.

Each of these pieces is supported by the wider Microsoft Security and governance process that allows you to manage and monitor the solutions deployed.

![Automation Center of Excellence Overview](https://powercat-automation-kit.azureedge.net/overview/Slide03.SVG)

<aside class="notes">

To successfully operate a Automation Center of excellence there are multiple components to build and grow over time. To accelerate this process the Automation Kit together with the CoE Kit allows you to combine hands-on tooling together with our whitepaper guidance to help you apply different components of your center of excellence.

For example the Automation Backlog can be used to brainstorm potential automation projects and decide on the projects to automate. This can be combined with a robust application lifecycle management process to build, deploy and monitor the solution.

From an operational and risk point of view to control access to connectors and data and provide operational telemetry on the impact of the deployed solutions against the defined targets.

<aside class="notes">

We have a continual process of looking at items that are prioritized from out backlog for inclusion in each milestone. Each milestone is a guide of when the feature may be released. This release schedule may change based on priority feedback from customers and meeting our quality gates prior to release.

Overtime features from the Automation Kit will be considered for inclusion in the the out of the box in product experience. As this occurs features will be deprecated from the Automation Kit to allow migration to the in product features.

For features where telemetry and customer impact show limited impact we will look to de-invest from those features so that we can focus on higher priority areas.
